# Second-Hand Book Sales Platform

This project involves the development of an online platform for buying and selling second-hand books. The website is built using ASP.NET and EntityFramework technologies to ensure a robust and scalable application. The platform allows users to create accounts, list their books for sale, and browse through available listings. Each book listing includes detailed information such as the title, author, condition and price.
